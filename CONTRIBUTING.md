## If you want to contribute new content
---
 - Open an issue describing your intended contribution. If you open an issue early it will give others the opprotunity to provide feedback, address concerns, and add any missing information. 
 - Create a pull request with the proposed contributions. A pull request doesn’t have to represent finished work. You can mark it as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line and add more commits later.
